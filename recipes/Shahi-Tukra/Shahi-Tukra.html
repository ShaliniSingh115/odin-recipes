    <p>
      Shahi Tukra (Indian Bread Pudding), is a very famous Hyderabadi dish and
      is a very simple, but rich dessert. It is great for a large dinner party
      as the recipe <br />can be easily multiplied to make more. It is best
      eaten chilled. If available, you can add a few drops of Kewra essence to
      the milk mixture once it has cooled.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
      <li>8 slices white bread, crusts removed and cut into 4 squares</li>
      <li>¼ cup cashews</li>
      <li>¼ cup sliced almonds</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pistachio nuts</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons evaporated milk</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1 pinch saffron</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step1</h4>
    <p>
      Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
      C). Fry the bread slices in the hot oil until deep, golden brown;<br />
      drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Fry the cashews, almonds, and
      pistachio nuts in the hot oil until golden brown;<br />
      remove from oil and set aside to cool. Chop roughly.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Bring the milk to a gentle boil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low
      heat; continue boiling until the volume of milk reduces by about half.
      <br />Pour the evaporated milk into the pan and add the sugar, cardamom,
      and saffron; simmer together 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow
      to cool completely.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Arrange the fried bread pieces in a shallow dish large enough to allow
      them to be laid in a single layer. Evenly pour the milk mixture over the
      bread. <br />Scatter the chopped nuts over the bread. Chill in
      refrigerator until completely cold, 1 to 2 hours.
