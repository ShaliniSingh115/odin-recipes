  <h1>Butter Chicken Recipe</h1>

    <p>
      This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite
      Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce <br />
      that complements the chicken well. It can be made as mild or spicy as you
      wish by adjusting the cayenne.<br />
      Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
      <li>¼ white onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ginger garlic paste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garam masala, divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
      <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
      <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>
        1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-size pieces
      </li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
      <li>¼ cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté
      shallot and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala,
      chili powder, cumin, and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute.<br />
      Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to frequently stir.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10
      minutes, frequently stirring. Season with salt and pepper.<br />
      Remove from heat and set aside.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat.
      Cook chicken until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>
      Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and
      cayenne. Stir in a few spoonfuls of sauce, <br />
      simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked
      chicken into sauce and stir together.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
      Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10
      minutes, or until thickened.
    </p>

    <h4>Ready ! Serve over rice with Naan</h4>
