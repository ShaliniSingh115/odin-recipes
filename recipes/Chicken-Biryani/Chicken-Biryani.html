      <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>
      Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise,
      and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>
      Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely
      chopped.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>
      Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice,
      ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, salt, biryani masala powder,<br />
      and turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with
      plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2 hours.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>
      Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce
      heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice<br />
      is partially cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>
      Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat.
      Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes.<br />
      Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and
      chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.<br />
      Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it aside.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>
      Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the
      pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink,<br />
      about 2 minutes per side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on
      top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and
      rice.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>
      Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low
      and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. <br />
      Remove from heat and let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an
      instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken <br />
      reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.
